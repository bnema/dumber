## [0.14.1] - 2025-11-18

### Added
- **Inline tab rename**: Press `Alt+T` then `r` to rename tabs directly in the tab bar. Enter saves, Escape cancels. Tab buttons temporarily allow focus during rename, then restore original focus behavior to prevent interfering with WebView keyboard input.
- **Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA support**: Temporary CORS allowlist workaround for `challenges.cloudflare.com` to bypass WebKit's incomplete COEP credentialless implementation. Allows Turnstile-protected sites to function properly. Configurable via `enable_turnstile_workaround` (default: true).
- **Global content filtering toggle**: New `content_filtering.enabled` config option to completely disable ad blocking when needed. Whitelist system remains available for granular control. Defaults to enabled for backward compatibility.

### Fixed
- **Search shortcut placeholders**: Support both `{query}` and `%s` placeholder formats in search shortcuts, allowing users to use either style. Also fixed domain-only URLs (e.g., "github.com") being incorrectly treated as search queries.
- **OAuth popup handling**: Fixed OAuth popups not functioning in stacked panes and split operations by ensuring `setupPopupHandling()` is called in all pane creation code paths (finalizeStackCreation, CloseStackedPane, splitNode).
- **WebView ID message parsing**: Fixed JSON unmarshaling errors when frontend sends numeric webviewId values instead of strings. Message handler now gracefully normalizes both string and numeric webviewId formats with fallback parsing logic.
- **Video codec fallback**: Unblocked VP8 codec to allow fallback for ad segments, preventing playback interruptions when ads use different codecs than main content.
- **Video buffering**: Increased buffer sizes (64 MB, 20s) to handle bursty Twitch/AV1 segments and improve streaming reliability on variable bitrate platforms.

### Changed
- **Console output cleanup**: Disabled WebKit console.log() messages to stdout to prevent page script spam. DevTools console (F12) still shows all messages.
- **Content filtering configuration**: Refactored `content_filtering_whitelist` into structured `content_filtering` config with `enabled` boolean and `whitelist` array for better organization.
