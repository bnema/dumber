## [0.15.0] - 2025-11-29

### Added
- **Inline URL suggestions**: Fish/zsh-style ghost text completion in omnibox. As you type, shows grayed-out URL completion from history. Accept with Right Arrow (full) or Ctrl+Right (word). Ctrl+Y also accepts full suggestion. Uses trie-based prefix search with debounced queries for smooth typing.
- **Filter list auto-update**: Async version checking using HTTP HEAD request with ETag. 2-minute startup delay, skips if checked within 24 hours. Stores version per filter list.
- **Configurable filter lists**: New `content_filtering.filter_lists` config option. Defaults include EasyList, EasyPrivacy, and uBlock filters (annoyances, quick-fixes).
- **Demo video**: Added feature showcase video to README (docs/media/dumber-demo.mp4).
- **Page load progress bar**: Thin animated indicator at window bottom showing web page loading progress. Tracks WebView load events with gradient animation, auto-hides when complete.
- **Omnibox initial history display**: Configurable behavior when opening empty omnibox via `omnibox.initial_behavior` ("recent", "most_visited", "none"). Shows initial history on open and when input is cleared. Default: recent visits.
- **Omnibox keyboard blocking**: Prevent page scripts from stealing focus while omnibox is active.
- **Configurable border widths**: Added `pane_mode_border_width` and `tab_mode_border_width` configuration options (default: 4px) for full border customization.
- **Content filter caching**: Centralized content blocking service compiles filters once and caches them for instant reuse across all WebViews.
- **CLI purge enhancements**: Separate `--cookies` and `--history` flags for granular data deletion.
- **URL normalization**: Consistent URL storage across browser, CLI, and favicon services (strips trailing slashes, normalizes schemes).

### Fixed
- **Filter compilation race condition**: Fixed concurrent map crash when multiple filter lists compile simultaneously by using local converter instead of shared state.
- **Omnibox search performance**: Debounce search with 2-character minimum threshold to prevent UI freeze on first keystroke. Applies to both URL/history search and find-in-page modes.
- **Omnibox flash on load**: Load the injected GUI bundle at document-start and initialize the omnibox as soon as DOM is ready, ensuring it is ready without briefly flashing during page startup or new pane creation.
- **Zoom toast suppression**: Suppress zoom toast notifications during browser initialization to prevent UI flash.
- **Cosmetic filter injection**: Inject rules immediately and fix selector normalization for better ad blocking.

### Changed
- **Refactor keyboard blocking**: Move logic to main-world.ts, reduce handler.go verbosity.
- **Border overlay architecture**: All borders (active pane, pane mode, tab mode) now use GTK overlay pattern preventing layout shifts when borders appear/disappear. Removed inactive border styling - only active panes show borders.
- **Simplified border configuration**: Removed `inactive_border_width`, `inactive_border_color`, `show_stacked_title_border`, and `border_radius` config options. All borders are now overlay-based with no layout impact.
- **Remove Turnstile workaround**: Removed temporary Cloudflare Turnstile CORS allowlist (no longer needed).
