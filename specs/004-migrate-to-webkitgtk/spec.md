## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user of the dumber browser, I want the browser to utilize modern GPU acceleration capabilities through Vulkan rendering, resulting in smoother scrolling, faster page rendering, and improved performance for graphics-intensive web content, while maintaining all existing browser functionality.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the browser, **When** they navigate to any website, **Then** the browser renders pages using GPU acceleration when available
2. **Given** a user visits a graphics-intensive website (e.g., with 3D content, animations), **When** the page loads, **Then** GPU rendering provides smooth performance without visual artifacts
3. **Given** a system with Vulkan-capable GPU, **When** the browser starts, **Then** it automatically detects and enables GPU acceleration
4. **Given** a system without Vulkan support, **When** the browser starts, **Then** it gracefully falls back to software rendering
5. **Given** the browser is using GPU acceleration, **When** monitoring system resources, **Then** CPU usage is reduced compared to software rendering

### Edge Cases
- What happens when GPU drivers are outdated or incompatible?
- How does system handle GPU driver crashes during browsing?
- What happens on systems with multiple GPUs (integrated + discrete)?
- How does browser perform on low-end GPUs vs high-end GPUs?
- What happens when switching between GPU and software rendering mid-session?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain all existing browser functionality after migration
- **FR-002**: System MUST support GPU-accelerated rendering when Vulkan-capable hardware is available
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide fallback to software rendering when GPU acceleration is unavailable
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing user data (bookmarks, history, settings)
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve current browser interface and user experience
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect GPU capabilities at startup and choose appropriate rendering path
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle GPU driver failures gracefully without crashing
- **FR-008**: Browser performance MUST improve by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific performance target not specified - 20%? 50%? What metrics?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST support common web standards (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) without regression
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain support for all previously working websites
- **FR-011**: GPU memory usage MUST remain within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable limits not specified]
- **FR-012**: Migration MUST be completed within [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timeline not specified]

### Key Entities
- **Browser Engine**: Core rendering engine that processes and displays web content
- **GPU Rendering Pipeline**: System component responsible for hardware-accelerated graphics
- **Fallback Renderer**: Software-based rendering system for non-GPU scenarios
- **Performance Monitor**: Component tracking rendering performance and resource usage
- **Compatibility Layer**: System ensuring existing functionality works with new rendering engine
