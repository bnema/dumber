# Feature Specification: Project Initialization with Dependencies

**Feature Branch**: `001-init-project`  
**Created**: 2025-01-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Lets init the project adding all deps"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí "Initialize project with all required dependencies"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developer, build system
   ‚Üí Actions: initialize, add dependencies, configure
   ‚Üí Data: project structure, dependency management
   ‚Üí Constraints: follow constitution requirements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major ambiguities - project structure defined in constitution
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear flow: developer initializes ‚Üí dependencies installed ‚Üí project ready
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable through build/run verification
6. Identify Key Entities: Go modules, dependencies, configuration files
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed
   ‚Üí No implementation details beyond necessary project structure
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer starting work on the dumber project, I need a properly initialized Go project with all required dependencies installed so that I can begin implementing features according to the project constitution without manual setup overhead.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an empty project directory, **When** project initialization is complete, **Then** the project has a valid Go module structure
2. **Given** the initialized project, **When** checking dependencies, **Then** all required packages from the constitution are available
3. **Given** the initialized project, **When** running basic build commands, **Then** no dependency resolution errors occur
4. **Given** the project structure, **When** examining the layout, **Then** it follows the planned architecture (CLI, database, browser components)

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Go version is incompatible with selected dependencies?
- How does system handle network failures during dependency installation?
- What occurs if required system packages (WebKit2GTK) are missing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST initialize a valid Go module with appropriate module path
- **FR-002**: System MUST install CLI framework dependencies (Cobra, Viper)
- **FR-003**: System MUST install database dependencies (SQLite driver, SQLC tooling)
- **FR-004**: System MUST install validation dependencies (go-playground/validator)
- **FR-005**: System MUST install Wails v3-alpha framework for browser integration
- **FR-006**: System MUST create basic project directory structure aligned with planned architecture
- **FR-007**: System MUST configure SQLC for type-safe database code generation
- **FR-008**: System MUST verify all dependencies are compatible and buildable
- **FR-009**: System MUST create configuration files needed for the development workflow

### Key Entities
- **Go Module**: The main project module with proper versioning and dependency management
- **Configuration Files**: SQLC config, Wails config, and other tool configurations
- **Project Structure**: Directory layout supporting CLI, database, and browser components
- **Dependencies**: External packages required per the constitution (Cobra, Viper, SQLite, SQLC, Wails, validator)
