## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a browser user, I want the browser to consume significantly less memory (40-60% reduction from current ~400MB per website) so that I can keep more browser instances open on my system without experiencing performance degradation or running out of memory.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a browser instance with default settings, **When** I navigate to a typical website, **Then** the browser should consume no more than 250MB of memory
2. **Given** I have browsed to 50 different web pages, **When** I check memory usage, **Then** memory consumption should remain stable and not exceed reasonable limits due to memory leaks
3. **Given** memory optimization is enabled, **When** the browser approaches memory limits, **Then** it should automatically clean up memory and maintain responsive performance
4. **Given** I configure memory optimization settings, **When** I restart the browser, **Then** my memory preferences should be preserved and applied

### Edge Cases
- What happens when memory pressure is extremely high (system running out of RAM)?
- How does the system handle memory optimization on low-memory devices (<4GB RAM)?
- What occurs when a single webpage requires more memory than the configured limit?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST reduce per-browser-instance memory usage by 40-60% compared to current baseline (~400MB to 150-250MB)
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide configurable memory limits and thresholds for different usage scenarios
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to choose between memory-optimized, balanced, and performance-optimized configurations
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically trigger memory cleanup when approaching configured memory limits
- **FR-005**: System MUST monitor and report memory usage statistics for transparency
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain browser stability and prevent crashes during memory optimization
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve essential browsing functionality (navigation, page rendering, basic JavaScript support)
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to manually trigger memory cleanup operations
- **FR-009**: System MUST support process recycling to prevent long-term memory accumulation
- **FR-010**: System MUST log memory optimization events for debugging and monitoring purposes

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Memory Configuration**: Settings that control memory optimization behavior, including memory limits, cleanup thresholds, caching policies, and garbage collection intervals
- **Memory Statistics**: Real-time and historical data about browser memory usage, including RSS memory, virtual memory, page load counts, and cleanup events
- **Optimization Preset**: Pre-configured sets of memory settings for different use cases (low-memory devices, balanced performance, high-performance scenarios)
