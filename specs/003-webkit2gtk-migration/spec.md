# Feature Specification: Native WebKit Browser Backend

**Feature Branch**: `003-webkit2gtk-migration`  
**Created**: 2025-01-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to ditch Wails and use Webkit2Gtk directly and create my own C go bindings"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer/power user of the dumb browser application, I need the browser to have full control over its web rendering engine and browser capabilities without being limited by third-party frameworks, so that I can customize browser behavior, optimize performance, and maintain direct access to all native browser features.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current browser uses a third-party framework, **When** I replace it with a native solution, **Then** the browser maintains all existing functionality (navigation, zoom, keyboard controls, history)
2. **Given** the native browser backend is implemented, **When** I want to add custom browser features, **Then** I can directly access and modify browser engine capabilities without framework limitations
3. **Given** the browser is running with the native backend, **When** users interact with web pages, **Then** performance is equal to or better than the previous framework-based implementation
4. **Given** the native backend is active, **When** the browser encounters different web content types, **Then** all standard web technologies render correctly

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the native bindings fail to load or initialize?
- How does the system handle web pages that stress-test browser engine capabilities?
- What occurs if the browser needs to interface with system-level features not exposed by the native bindings?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST render web pages with full HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript support equivalent to modern browsers
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain all existing browser controls (navigation, zoom, keyboard shortcuts) without regression
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve existing user data (history, bookmarks, zoom settings) during migration
- **FR-004**: System MUST support the same web content types and media formats as the current implementation
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide identical or improved page loading performance compared to current framework
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain cross-platform compatibility [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which platforms need to be supported - Linux only, or multiple platforms?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle browser crashes gracefully without data loss
- **FR-008**: System MUST support developer tools and debugging capabilities for web content
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain security features like sandboxing and content security policies
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide memory management equivalent to or better than current implementation

### Key Entities
- **Browser Engine Interface**: The abstraction layer that handles web content rendering, JavaScript execution, and browser feature access
- **Native Bindings**: The interface components that connect high-level application code with low-level browser engine capabilities
- **Migration State**: Configuration and data preservation mechanisms that ensure seamless transition from old to new backend
